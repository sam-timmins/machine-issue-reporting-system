# Background
With the restrictions in place within teaching in the Irish Universities due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the improved organisation of working methods to reduce contact with staff and students over more trivial tasks have to be looked at. With this in mind, TU Dublin's engineering department has been looking to implement a machinery issue reporting system for the many machines to which the students have access. Currently, the engineering department is using a manual process where students write into a diary, where unnecessary physical touchpoints are created, or send an email where there is potential for loss of information to happen. They are looking to create an automated system to improve the procedure for all stakeholders.

# Mission Statement
Provide a fully automated, easily used and aesthetically pleasing machinery issue reporting system for TU Dublin.

# Target Audience
The target audience consists of approximately 150 students, both full time and part-time. The students are of a similar educational standard due to the course entry requirements but there is a selection that has extra educational needs so this needs to be addressed with accessibility built into the application.

There are three members of staff, one technician and two lecturers.

# Stakeholder Interviews
I carried out short interviews with both a selection of staff and students that this project will affect. All people interviewed will be *Users*, however for an easier view of the breakdown of requirements, I have split the results into *students* and *staff*.

## Student Persona
These are the details of the students interviewed. Two criteria were taken into consideration when selecting appropriate candidates for interviews. Firstly that they are either a part-time or full-time student of TU Dublin, and also that the course they are enrolled on is within the engineering department.

| Name | Age | Course | Education |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Don Heslip| 22 | Automation Engineering | Leaving Cert |
| Aodhgon Smith | 19 | Aviation Technology | Leaving Cert |
| Niall McCarthy | 34 | Design Technology and Innovation | Leaving Cert |
| Elaine Cross | 22 | Structural Engineering | Leaving Cert |

## Student Goals
From the resulting interviews, the user goals have been defined:
* See what defects or issues have been reported
* See what defects or issues I have reported
* Clear display in a landing page
* Clear navigation process
* Ability to use the system on a mobile phone

## Student Stories
* As a student, I want to have a clear and defined landing page
* As a student, I want to be able to report aa issue on a machine
* As a student, I want to see any issues that I have reported
* As a student, I want to see the machine's name and description
* As a student, I want to see if there are any issues already reported on a machine
* As a student, I want to know this is a TU Dublin application

## Student Requirements and Expectations
### Requirements
* Simple and well laid out
* Visually appealing
* TU Dublin colour pallet
* Clean and modern looking
* Easy to report an issue in just a few clicks
* Responsive design is required (Mobile first) as users may be viewing the site on Mobile, Tablet or Desktop

### Expectations
* I expect to use the application on any size device without the experience effected
* I expect that when I report an issue I can see that it has been logged
* I expect to be able to report issues on multiple machines

### Strategy Outline
The items are graded in a 0 - 5 system in both importance and feasibility as per the grading system below.

&nbsp;

| | Score - 0 | Score - 3 | Score - 5 |
|--|--|--| -- |
| Importance | Unwise use of time to address | Efforts should be made to accommodate these | Efforts MUST be made to address these
| Feasibility | Unwise use of time to address| Efforts should be made to accommodate these | Efforts MUST be made to address these

&nbsp;

The outcome is calculated by combining the scores from the *Importance* and *Feasibility* ratings. This then gives a final strategy rating of what items and where to focus on.

| | Score - 0 | Score - 5 | Score - 10 |
|--|--|--| -- |
| Item Description | Not viable | Efforts should be made | Efforts MUST be made
